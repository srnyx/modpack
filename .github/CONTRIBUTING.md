* **Contribute to mods** - simple things like suggesting features, reporting bugs when you encounter an issue and translating your language really do help out the mods.

* **Give feedback to the pack** - giving your ideas on what to add or change about the pack makes sure that we all can get the best quality out of it. Mod suggestions and bugs [can be posted to issues here](https://github.com/srnyx/modpack/issues) and general questions are expected on [Discord](https://srnyx.xyz/discord).

* **Contribute to SM toolkit** - know some batch (or other languages)? Feel free to improve my scripts by forking and making a pull request.
